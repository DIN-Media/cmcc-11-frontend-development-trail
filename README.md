CoreMedia Blueprint
=======================

This is the public repository for the CoreMedia Blueprints Workspace, it contains branches for each product and platform version, ie. `cms9-1701`, where `cms9` represents the product and `1701` represents the platform version. The history of each product is continued from platform version to platform version, i.e. 
```
                    1704.1  1704.2
cms-9-1704 :--------|-------|------------ HEAD
                             \
cms-9-1706                    `---------- HEAD                    


                                      1604.1     1604.2     1604.3    1604.4
livecontext-3-for-ibm-wcs-1604: :-----|----------|----------|---------|
                                                                       \     1701.0     1701.2
