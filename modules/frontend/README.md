# CoreMedia Blueprint

## Frontend Module

This is the main module for all frontend developers. It includes reusable bricks, configs, node modules for reuse and
our themes for our example websites.

More informations:

- [Themes](themes/README.md)
- [Bricks](lib/bricks/README.md)
- [Additional libs, tools and scripts](lib/README.md)

### Requirements

For Java developers:

 - At least JDK7 and Maven 3.3.3, see [Frontend maven plugin](https://github.com/eirslett/frontend-maven-plugin)
 
For Web developers:
 
 - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (6.x)
 - [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (3.x)
 - [Grunt CLI](http://gruntjs.com/) (v1.2.0)
 
### Installation

Call Maven to build frontend module.

```$ mvn install```

If you don't want to use Maven, you have to install at least node.js, which includes npm. npm stands for node packaged 
modules and is a way to manage development dependencies through node.js.

```$ npm install```
```$ npm run production```

You can run tests via ```$ npm test```.

Both variants include building all available themes.

### Running local webserver

You need an available CoreMedia contentserver and Java with Maven. Call the Maven Tomcat Plugin to run the CAE Webserver.

```$ mvn tomcat7:run -pl :cae-preview-webapp -Dinstallation.host=<YourCMSHost>```

Open your browser at ```http://localhost:40980/blueprint/servlet/<YourDemoSite>```

### Generating API Docs

The JavaScript files include documentation comments according to [JSDoc 3](http://usejsdoc.org). The documentation is 
generated to API Markdown files inside the bricks. To recreate the API documentation run ```$ npm run apidoc``` 
or ```$ grunt apidoc```.

### Troubleshooting

Should you encounter problems with installing dependencies or running grunt commands, first delete the
```/node/``` and ```/node_modules/``` directory generated by npm and mvn. As alternative use ```mvn clean``` to delete these 
folders. Then, rerun `npm install` or `mvn install`.

#### Known Issues

If you're working offline or with slow networks, avoid calling ```mvn clean``` because this will clear all 
```node_modules``` and force some not cachable files to be downloaded again.
