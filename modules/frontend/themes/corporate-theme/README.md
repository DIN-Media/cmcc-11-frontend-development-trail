# CoreMedia Blueprint

## Corporate Theme

The Corporate Theme provides a modern, appealing, highly visual theme. It demonstrates the capability to build 
localizable, multi-national, non-commerce websites.

Based on a fully responsive, mobile-first design paradigm, it leverages the Twitter Bootstrap Grid and Design framework 
for easy customization and adaptation by frontend developers. It scales from mobile via tablet to desktop viewport sizes 
and uses the CoreMedia Adaptive and Responsive Image Framework to dynamically deliver the right image sizes in the right 
aspect ratios and crops. The responsive navigation visualizes 3 levels, even though the navigation structure can be 
arbitrary deeply nested. The floating header and the footer can be configured and re-ordered in content settings.
