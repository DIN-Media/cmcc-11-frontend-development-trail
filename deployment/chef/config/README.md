# Config files

* `knife.rb` - example knife configuration, place this in your `~/.chef-repo/.chef` path and configure it.
* `cachier.rb` - vagrant cachier config included by kitchen to cache files between boxes.
* `linked-clones.rb` - activates linked clones in vagrant/virtualbox. This speeds up the box import massively.
* `spork-config.yml` - configures knife-spork to manage environments.
* `ci-setenv` - insource this in your jenkins shell step to run cookbook ci.


## Vagrant specific configuration includes

In this folder, you can add Ruby files to be included in the Vagrantfile generated by test kitchen. To include a file 
from this location, it must be added to the array set on the `vagrantfiles` attribute in the `.kitchen.yml` file.

Example:

```yaml
---
driver:
  name: vagrant
  vagrantfiles: 
    - 'config/cachier.rb'
```

The path to the Ruby file is relative to test-kitchen.
