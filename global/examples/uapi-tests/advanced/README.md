# UAPI Tests â€“ Advanced Level

These are examples of advanced UAPI testing using the so-called XML repository
to mock a real content-server.

While you may directly want to dive into the advanced features, you may want
to have a look at the [basic examples](../basic/README.md) first, to get to
know the general structure and setup of these tests.
